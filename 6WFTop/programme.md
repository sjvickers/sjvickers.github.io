Programme
======


Our aim is to provide ample space for discussion.
To this end, talks will be limited to an hour (for invited speakers) or 45 minutes (contributed talks), leaving the rest of the slot for questions and discussion.

You can also see [abstracts](./talks).

6WFTop sessions will be in LG rooms of the **Old Gym** near the centre of Birmingham University main (Edgbaston) campus, building Y1 on the
[campus map](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/university/edgbaston-campus-map.pdf).
It is 5 minutes or less from the Computer Science building Y9 and University Station,
and around 10 minutes from Edgbaston Park Hotel, building G23.

The [Sambin/Vickers Saturday](#sambinvickers) will take place in room UG06 in a different building,
the Murray Learning Centre building R28, which is directly opposite Computer Science.

We'll start from a quote from Bourbaki "Introduction to the Theory of Sets", archived as
[R154_nbr_055](http://sites.mathdoc.fr/archives-bourbaki/feuilleter.php?chap=2_REDAC_E1)


"... nowadays it is known to be possible, logically speaking, to
derive practically the whole of known mathematics from a single source,
the Theory of Sets. ... By so doing we do not claim to legislate for
all time. It may happen at some future date that mathematicians will agree
to use modes of reasoning which cannot be formalized in the language
described here; according to some, the recent evolution of axiomatic homology
theory would be a sign that this date is not so far.
It would then be necessary, if not to change the language
completely, at least to enlarge its rules of syntax. But this is for the future
to decide."

Now we are the future, what might we decide?
