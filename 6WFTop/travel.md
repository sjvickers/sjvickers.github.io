Travel to Birmingham
====================

The University has provided [general information on travel to Birmingham University](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/contact/directions/getting-here-edgbaston.aspx); we've added some comments below.

###By air
If possible, it is best to fly to **Birmingham Airport (BHX)**, as rail connections from there to Birmingham are excellent. There are direct flights from many European cities but especially the major hubs such as Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt, and you can generally get reasonable indirect flights changing at one of those.

Another relatively close airport is
[**East Midlands Airport (EMA)**](https://www.eastmidlandsairport.com/),
but then you need to travel by Coach (which is confortable) to Birmingham coach station.

The **London airports** Heathrow (LHR), Gatwick (LGW), Stansted (STN), and Luton (LTN) are also possible, although you will have a longer and more expensive onward travel to Birmingham.

###Rail
The main station in Birmingham is **Birmingham New Street**, with direct and frequent services to **Birmingham International** (for the airport) and **University** station (for Birmingham University).

The [on-line information about train times and prices](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/) also allows you to book tickets.

British train pricing can be quite complicated, even for the British.
In general, tickets valid at workday peak times are much more expensive than off-peak tickets, especially for travel via London, and off-peak returns are cheaper than two singles. If you buy tickets at the station, specify your approximate outward and return times and they should sell you the cheapest ticket to cover that. On-line (only) you can also sometimes get even cheaper deals _if_ you can commit yourself to particular trains.
