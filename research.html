<h2>Point-free topology</h2>
<p>
What makes a map f: X -> Y <i>continuous</i>?
That means that if you jiggle the argument x around a little - not too much - to neighbouring points, then the result f(x) won't make any sudden jumps.
Obviously, to make that precise, you have to give more meaning to "jiggle around" and "neighbouring".
</p>
<p>
Most mathematicians say that you take a set like X and then specify that some subsets are "open".
This means that every element of the open subset also has some jiggle room around it, still within the open subset.
The structure of X, together with the specification of which subsets are open, is then a <i>point-set topological space</i>.
Once both X and Y have that structure, continuity means that for each open subset V containing f(x), there is some jiggle room round x within which the result is still in V; and this is witnessed by an open subset U containing x and with f(U) included in V.
</p>
<p>
This definition has been broadly accepted through most of the 20th century, but since perhaps the 60s there has been growing recognition of problems with taking X and Y as <i>sets</i> equipped with extra structure.
In a mathematics founded on set theory, the default assumption is that all collections are sets (with the exception of some, proper classes, that are known to be "too big").
However, this becomes much more delicate if you want to consider "variable sets" X(z), parametrized by points z of some other topological space Z.
Obviously it would be nice to just "do topology" with these, by sprinkling parameters z everywhere, but that doesn't really work with the point-set definition.
The problem is that there are variable <i>spaces</i> we should like to capture that don't have satisfactory variable <i>sets</i> for their points.
</p>
<p>
A solution is provided by <i>point-free</i> topology.
Here we don't assume that the collection of points X can be represented satisfactorily as a set.
In fact we don't assume it is known until we have described the topology.
The way this works is to consider each open U not as a set of points, but as a logical property "x in U" that is meaningful for the points (whatever the points are).
In this style, some interactions between the opens, which previously were implicit in the knowledge of what the points were, have to be stated explicitly as logical axioms.
Once that is done, we have a <i>logical theory</i>, and the points can now be defined as its models.
</p>
<p>
The logic that must be used, the so-called <i>geometric logic</i>, is a bit unusual, and arises out of Grothendieck's topos theory.
One illuminating way to view it, which comes out of ideas (Abramsky, Smyth) of the role of topology in computer science, is that it is a logic of what you can actually observe.
I used that as the basis of my book
"<a href="papersfull.html#TVL">Topology via Logic</a>"
(also, in more detail, the article
"<a href="papersfull.html#Ontology">Issues of logic, algebra and topology in ontology</a>").
We can now define -
</p>
<p>
<i>A point-free topological space is a geometric theory. Its points are the models of that theory.</i>
</p>
<p>
A key aspect of this is that the theory may be a first-order theory. This insight lies right at the heart of topos theory, because the same definition then admits some point-free spaces, the toposes, that vastly generalize the old point-set ones.
For example, the class of sets becomes a point-free space (the "object classifier").
The geometric logic then gives rise to a geometric <i>mathematics</i>, and it turns out that continuity depends on restricting oneself to that geometric mathematics.
</p>
<p>
<i>A continuous map from X to Y is a construction, within geometric mathematics, of points of Y out of points of X.</i>
</p>
<p>
Much mathematics has already been accomplished in this geometric style.
How much more can be done, and in particular how much topos theory, is still an open question that invites further exploration.
</p>

<p>
"Geometric logic", so-called from its origins in algebraic geometry
in the mid 20th century, is an ingenious way to combine two apparently
very different mathematical subjects:
<i>topology</i> (which studies continuous change) and <i>logic</i> (which
studies discrete deduction steps).</p>
<p>
Its trick is to take the set-theoretic operations of intersection and (possibly
infinite) union, which are used to combine the important <i>open sets</i>
of topology, and reinterpret them as logic. Intersection becomes "and",
and union becomes "or". Because it has a restricted range of logical connectives
it is weaker than the standard "classical" logic of mathematics,
though the ability to form
"infinite ors" gives it some interesting features.</p>
<p>
Under this translation, topological spaces, their points,
and continuous maps between the spaces become logical theories, models and interpretations
of one theory in another.</p>
<p>
The trick of geometric logic arose in fields of pure mathematics, notably algebraic
geometry, and led to some interesting "point-free" styles of topology, in which
the open sets on a space are defined without knowing in advance what points they are
meant to be sets of. The idea has also been used in computer science, where the idea
of continuity turns out to be unexpectedly close to that of <i>computability</i>.
Then the point-free approach describes spaces of computational objects by logical
theories of "how those objects appear to the user" (i.e. what you can know of
them by watching them run, as opposed to examining their programs).</p>

<a name="toposes"></a>
<h3>Toposes</h3>
<p>
In essence the trick of geometric logic is a simple one, but it has deep consequences.
These arise because the weaker, geometric, logic goes along with a weaker, geometric,
mathematics, one that
is more compatible with what can be computed. Its constructions have an intrinsic
continuity - its weakness is that it cannot do <i>dis</i>continuous things.
The study of what can be done in this geometric mathematics leads to the notion
of <i>topos</i>.</p>
<p>
Topos theory is an astonishingly rich subject dating back to Grothendieck's work on
algebraic geometry half a century ago. It has had a profound effect on other fields
too, including logic.
Partly because of this richness it is notoriously difficult to give a comprehensive
conceptual account of what a topos is, but I shall try to explain the way I think of
those aspects that enter into my own work.</p>
<p>
A topos is analogous to a topological space, but its topological structure cannot
be described just using open sets of points. Instead, they must be described by
specifying what are the <i>sheaves</i>, or continuous maps from the points to <i>sets</i>.
The sheaves are equivalent to the ways of constructing sets from points in the
geometric mathematics. This creates a powerful connection between geometric logic
and toposes.</p>
<p>
A topos is generally said to <i>classify</i> its points, so for example there is
a topos that classifies sets, and another that classifies groups.</p>
<p>
Toposes can also be understood independently of geometric logic, via another
"intuitionistic" logic that is stronger than geometric, but still weaker than
classical logic. However, restricting to geometric logic makes it much easier
to understand toposes as spaces of points. Much of my work has studied
the question of how much
practical mathematics can be done within the constraints of geometric logic.</p>

<a name="bundles"></a>
<h3>Sheaves and bundles</h3>
<p>
I said above that a <i>sheaf</i> over a space <i>X</i> can be understood as
a continuous map from points of <i>X</i> to sets. The result of this map applied
to a point <i>x</i> is called the <i>stalk</i> of the sheaf at <i>x</i>; it is a set.
By putting together all the elements of all the stalks one gets another space <i>Y</i>,
called the <i>display space</i>, with a map <i>p</i>: <i>Y</i> -> <i>X</i> that shows,
for each element of <i>Y</i>, which stalk it comes from.</p>
<p>
A map <i>p</i> got in this way is of a special kind, called a <i>local homeomorphism</i>. Thus in a local homeomorphism <i>p</i>: <i>Y</i> -> <i>X</i>, the stalk at any point
<i>x</i> of <i>X</i> can be found by looking at the <i>inverse image</i> of <i>x</i>,
the set of points <i>y</i> such that <i>p</i>(<i>y</i>) = <i>x</i>.
This is also known as the <i>fibre</i> over <i>x</i>.</p>
<p>
Now the idea of fibre works for any map <i>p</i> - it does not have to be a
local homeomorphism. But in general the fibre has a topology of its own, so we should
think of it as a topological space rather than a set. Thus <i>p</i> gets viewed as a
variable space (the fibre), varying as the point <i>x</i> varies. From this point of view
I shall call <i>p</i> a <i>bundle</i>.
(Note for the knowledgeable: I'm not making any other assumptions, such as whether the
fibres are non-empty.) Then a sheaf is a bundle in which all the fibres are sets - they
have the discrete topology. A sheaf is a "bundle of sets".</p>
<p>
Remarkably, the bundle idea still works in point-free topology, and in some ways
it actually works even better. The "internal mathematics of toposes" mentioned above,
when done for sheaves over <i>X</i>, amounts to a set theory "parametrized by points
of <i>X</i>". (This works best when you restrict yourself to the geometric mathematics.)
An old and important result of topos theory shows that when you simulate
point-free topology in this internal mathematics, you end up with a mathematics
of point-free bundles.</p>
<p>
In other words, you can discuss bundles in the same way as you discuss spaces,
so long as you work (i) point-free, and (ii) in geometric logic. Since geometric logic
is weaker than classical logic, this makes it quite interesting to ask how much of
ordinary mathematics can be done geometrically. Much of my work has been looking at
particular instances of this question.</p>

<h3>More technical issues</h3>
<p>
As I mentioned, much of my work investigates how ordinary mathematics can be done
in geometric logic. The underlying problem is that a point-free space may really not have
enough points. In logical terms (point = model of a theory), this is because geometric
theories may be incomplete. But that shortage of points is only if the models are sought
in ordinary sets. There will always be enough points if you are prepared to seek
models in non-standard sets (i.e. in the internal mathematics of toposes).
The advantage of geometric logic is that it applies equally well in all those
non-standard universes, and transports cleanly between them
(technically: it is preserved by inverse image functors of geometric morphisms).
Hence by reasoning geometrically you cover also these non-standard points, and of them
there are enough.
<p>
Many of the ideas are set out in
<a href="papersfull.html#TCD"><i>Topical categories of domains</i></a>, which investigates
results known from domain theory and the semantics of computer programming languages (in particular, the results of Samson Abramsky's logical approach).
It uses geometric logic to exploit in a deep way the idea of classifying toposes as
spaces of points.</p>
<p>
An important tool is the theory of <i>powerlocales</i>, or "point-free hyperspaces".
(A <i>hyperspace</i> is a space whose points are subspaces of some other space.
As <i>powerdomains</i> they have proved an effective tool for discussing
non-determinism in computation, since the result of a function then may be a subspace
of points rather than a single point.)
These give a powerful way to discuss issues such as compactness
and I have used them throughout my work.
Their good interaction with geometric logic is described in detail in
<a href="papersfull.html#PPandExp"><i>The double powerlocale and exponentiation</i></a>,
which investigates Martin Hyland's famous result from point-free topology on the ability to construct
spaces of maps (and, technically, on local compactness).</p>

<a name="AUs"></a>
<h3>Arithmetic universes</h3>
<p>
One important consequence of the infinitary disjunctions in geometric logic is that
there is a "geometric type theory" to go with it.
An interesting question,
proposed in <a href="papersfull.html#TCD"><i>Topical categories of domains</i></a>
and discussed in
<a href="papersfull.html#LocTopSpaces"><i>Locales and toposes as spaces</i></a>,
concerns what happens if one combines some of the type theory with the <i>finitary</i>
geometric logic, i.e. coherent logic. This is an "arithmetic" logic, and corresponds to
using Joyal's <i>arithmetic universes</i> as a substitute for
Grothendieck toposes.
Though it is formally less powerful than geometric logic,
it is at least strong enough to cover real numbers
and leads to a constructive logic that does not depend on choosing
a base elementary topos "of sets".
</p>
<p>
Grothendieck topos theory might be characterized as
"generalized point-free topology",
where the generalization is to spaces of models of non-propositional geometric theories,
and consequently the point-free approach has to shift
from lattices (of opens) to categories (of sheaves).
See my <a href="talks.html#TACL2017">TACL talks</a> 1-4.
</p>
<p>
The methodology then is that a space <i>is</i>
a Grothendieck topos (the category of sheaves),
and a continuous map <i>is</i> a geometric morphism.
However, a the category of sheaves
has to be based on a given category of sets.
That could be any elementary topos with natural numbers object,
not necessarily the classical sets;
but the fact of having to choose is itself a nuisance
that makes it harder to be foundationally robust.
</p>
<p>
  The AU dream is to state and prove topological results in
  a constructive, foundationally robust way
  that does not depend on choosing a base topos
  (or a base anything).
  See my <a href="talks.html#TACL2017">TACL talks</a> 5.
</p>
<p>
  At present we are a long way from realising that dream
  in algebraic topology, which presents big challenges.
  Grothendieck used toposes as a place in which to do
  sheaf cohomology, and those techniques would certainly not
  work unmodified with AUs.

I am now retired from Birmingham University, though I still take part in research activities of the Theory Group.
In principle, as an honorary member of staff, I can still supervise PhD students. However, it is most unlikely that there would be any university funding available for it.
