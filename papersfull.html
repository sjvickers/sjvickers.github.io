This paper investigates the absolute values on Z valued in the upper reals (i.e. reals for which only a right Dedekind section is given). These necessarily include multiplicative seminorms corresponding to the finite prime fields F_p. As an Ostrowski-type Theorem, the space of such absolute values is homeomorphic to a space of prime ideals (with co-Zariski topology) suitably paired with upper reals in the range [-\infty,1], and from this is recovered the standard Ostrowski's Theorem for absolute values on Q.
<br>
Our approach is fully constructive, using, in the topos-theoretic sense, geometric reasoning with point-free spaces, and that calls for a careful distinction between Dedekinds vs. upper reals. This forces attention on topological subtleties that are obscured in the classical treatment. In particular, the admission of multiplicative seminorms points to connections with Berkovich and adic spectra. The results are also intended to contribute to characterising a (point-free) space of places of Q.

Working in point-free topology under the constraints of geometric logic, we prove the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, and apply it to prove the usual rules for the derivatives of x^\alpha, \gamma^x, and log_\gamma x.

We survey foundational principles of Grothendieck's generalized spaces, including a critical glossary of the various, and often conflicting, terminological usages.
	
Known results using generalized points support a fully pointwise notation for these essentially point-free structures. This includes some from dependent type theory to deal with bundles as continuous space-valued maps, mapping base point to fibre.<br>

We define a point-free construction of real exponentiation and logarithms, i.e. we construct the maps
$\exp\colon (0,\infty)\times \mathbb{R}\to(0,\infty),
(x,\zeta)\mapsto x^\zeta$ and
$\log\colon (1,\infty)\times(0,\infty)\to\mathbb{R},
(b,y)\mapsto \log_b(y)$,
and we develop familiar algebraic rules for them. The point-free approach is constructive, and defines the points of a space as models of a geometric theory, rather than as elements of a set -- in particular, this allows geometric constructions to be applied to points living in toposes other than Set. Our geometric development includes new lifting and gluing techniques in point-free topology, which highlight how properties of $\mathbb{Q}$ determine properties of real exponentiation.
This work is motivated by our broader research programme of developing a version of adelic geometry via topos theory. In particular, we wish to construct the classifying topos of places of $\mathbb{Q}$, which will provide a geometric perspective into the subtle relationship between $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{Q}_p$, a question of longstanding number-theoretic interest. <br>

Suppose an extension map $U\colon \mathbb{T}_1 \to \mathbb{T}_0$
in the 2-category $\mathfrak{Con}$ of contexts for
arithmetic universes satisfies a Chevalley criterion for being an (op)fibration in $\mathfrak{Con}$.
If $M$ is a model of $\mathbb{T}_0$ in an elementary topos $\mathcal{S}$ with nno, then the classifier
$p\colon \mathcal{S}[\mathbb{T}_1 /M] \to \mathcal{S}$ satisfies the representable definition of being an (op)fibration
in the 2-category $\mathfrak{ETop}$ of elementary toposes (with nno) and geometric morphisms.

The significance of the results for the AU programme lies in the question of how to construct colimits of generalized spaces.
For the original topos implementation,
this comes cheaply as colimits of Grothendieck toposes are limits
of the underlying categories.
However, there can still be a need to find a geometric description of
the points,
and this can be seen in
"<a href="#TopCat">Topical categories of domains</a>".
There coproducts and lifted spaces (which classify partial points,
and are cocommas of a unique map to 1 with an identity map)
are constructed using the bagtoposes of
"<a href="#GTD">Geometric theories and databases</a>".
This need is even stronger in $\mathfrak{Con}$,
where the generalized spaces are taken as <i>being</i>
the AU analogues of geometric theories.
Johnstone showed that the bagtoposes are partial products,
a generalization of exponentials,
but for its correct 2-categorical characterization the notion of partial product depends on an analysis of the (op)fibration properties.
For these reasons I expect an understanding of (op)fibrations in
$\mathfrak{Con}$ to be important in constructing colimits there.
The present paper gives that understanding and connects it to
the established theory for toposes.

  The paper uses structures in $\mathfrak{Con}$,
  the author's 2-category of sketches for arithmetic universes (AUs),
  to provide constructive, base-independent results for Grothendieck toposes (bounded $\mathcal{S}$-toposes)
  as generalized spaces.
<br/>
  The main result is to show how an extension map
  $U\colon \mathbb{T}_1 \to \mathbb{T}_0$ can be viewed as a bundle,
  transforming base points (models of $\mathbb{T}_0$ in any elementary topos $\mathcal{S}$ with nno)
  to fibres (generalized spaces over $\mathcal{S}$).
<br/>
  Features of the work include comparison of strict and non-strict models,
  using properties of the objects of $\mathfrak{Con}$;
  the use of Gray tensor products to relate syntactic transformation of models
  by 1-cells in $\mathfrak{Con}$ and semantic transformations by non-strict AU-functors;
  and the use of 2-fibrations to index over a 2-category of base toposes $\mathcal{S}$.

  A theory of sketches for arithmetic universes (AUs) is developed.
<br/>
  A restricted notion of sketch, called here <i>context</i>,
  is defined with the property that every non-strict model is uniquely isomorphic to a strict model.
  This allows us to reconcile the syntactic, dealt with strictly using universal algebra,
  with the semantic, in which non-strict models must be considered.

  For any context $\mathbb{T}$, a concrete construction is given of the AU $\mathbf{AU}\langle\mathbb{T}\rangle$
  freely generated by it.

  A 2-category $\mathfrak{Con}$ of contexts is defined, with a full and faithful 2-functor to the 2-category
  of AUs and strict AU-functors,
  given by $\mathbb{T} \mapsto \mathbf{AU}\langle\mathbb{T}\rangle$.
  It has finite pie limits,
  and also all pullbacks of a certain class of "extension" maps.
  Every object, morphism or 2-cell of $\mathfrak{Con}$ is a finite structure.

The locale corresponding to the real interval $[-1,1]$ is an interval object, in the sense
  of Escard\'{o} and Simpson, in the category of locales.
  The map $c\colon 2^\omega \to [-1,1]$, mapping a stream $s$ of signs $\pm 1$ to
  $\Sigma_{i=1}^\infty s_i 2^{-i}$, is a proper localic surjection;
  it is also expressed as a coequalizer.

A "bundle endofunctor preserving proneness" for a cartesian category $\mathcal{C}$
is an endofunctor $\mathfrak{T}_\bullet$ of the arrow category $\mathcal{C}^{\downarrow}$,
the identity on codomains, that preserves the property of morphisms of being pullback squares.
Such a $\mathfrak{T}_\bullet$ is "slicewise strong",
restricting to a strong endofunctor $\mathfrak{T}_\bullet$ on every slice $\mathcal{C}/B$,
and with that structure preserved by pullback between slices.
<br>
In the other direction, a strong endofunctor $T$ on $\mathcal{C}$ extends to a bundle endofunctor
$T_\bullet$ on $\mathcal{C}$, which preserves proneness if $T$ preserves coreflexive equalizers.
<br>
If a bundle endofunctor $\mathfrak{T}_\bullet$ preserving proneness also preserves coreflexive equalizers,
then it is naturally isomorphic to the $T_\bullet$ arising from $T = \mathfrak{T}_1$.
<br>
Combining these, bundle endofunctors for $\mathcal{C}$ preserving proneness and coreflexive equalizers
are equivalent to strong endofunctors on $\mathcal{C}$ preserving coreflexive equalizers;
this latter structure is inherited by all slices and preserved by pullback between them.
<br>
The results extend to situations where $\mathfrak{T}_\bullet$ and $T$ are monads.
<br>
We propose that the structure of bundle endofunctor preserving proneness is a satisfactory
categorical abstraction of the notion of geometric construction when $\mathcal{C}$ is the
category $\mathbf{Loc}$ of locales.
The powerlocales give rise to bundle monads on $\mathbf{Loc}$ preserving proneness
and coreflexive equalizers;
likewise for the covariant powerobject monad on any topos.

  Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a representable 2-category,
  and $\mathfrak{T}_\bullet$ a 2-endofunctor of
  the arrow 2-category $\mathcal{C}^\downarrow$ such that
  (i) $\mathsf{cod} \mathfrak{T}_\bullet
        = \mathsf{cod} \colon \mathcal{C}^\downarrow \rightarrow \mathcal{C}$ and
  (ii) $\mathfrak{T}_\bullet$  preserves proneness (cartesianness)
  of morphisms in $\mathcal{C}^\downarrow$.
  Then $\mathfrak{T}_\bullet$  preserves fibrations and opfibrations in $\mathcal{C}$.

  The proof takes Street's characterization of (e.g.) opfibrations as pseudoalgebras
  for 2-monads $\mathfrak{L}_B$ on slice categories $\mathcal{C}/B$
  and develops it by defining a 2-monad $\mathfrak{L}_\bullet$  on $\mathcal{C}^\downarrow$
  that takes change of base into account, and uses known results on the lifting
  of 2-functors to pseudoalgebras.

This paper analyses the notion of a <i>positivity relation</i>
of Formal Topology from the point of view of the theory of Locales. It is shown that a positivity relation on a locale corresponds
to a suitable class of points of its lower powerlocale.
In particular, closed subtopologies associated to the
positivity relation correspond to overt
(that is, with open domain) weakly closed sublocales.
Finally, some connection is revealed between positivity
relations and localic suplattices
(these are algebras for the powerlocale monad).

In the topos approach to quantum theory by Heunen, Landsman and Spitters, one associates to any
unital C*-algebra <i>A</i>, a topos <i>T(A)</i>
of sheaves on a locale and a commutative C*-algebra A within
that topos.
The Gelfand spectrum of A is a locale &Sigma;
in this topos, which is equivalent to a bundle
over the base locale. We further develop this external presentation of the locale &Sigma;, by noting that the
construction of the Gelfand spectrum in a general topos can be described using geometric logic.
As a consequence, the spectrum, seen as a bundle, is computed fibrewise.
<br>
As a by-product of the geometricity of Gelfand spectra,
we find an explicit external description
of the spectrum whenever the topos is a functor category.
As an intermediate result we show that
locally perfect maps compose, so that the externalization of a locally compact locale in a topos of
sheaves over a locally compact locale is locally compact, too.</p>

Topos approaches to quantum foundations are described in a unified way by means of spectral bundles,
where the base space is a space of contexts and each fibre is its spectrum.
Differences in variance are due to the the bundle being a fibration or opfibration.
Relative to this structure, the probabilistic predictions of the Born rule in finite dimensional
settings are then described as a section of a bundle of valuations.
The construction uses in an essential way the geometric nature of the valuation locale monad.

If <i>X</i> is a locale then its valuation locale has for its points the valuations on
<i>X</i>. This construction is the functor part of a strong monad on the category of
locales, a localic analogue of the Giry monad. It is commutative, i.e. product valuations
exist and a Fubini Theorem holds. An analogue of the Riesz Representation theorem holds.
Concrete representations are given for the tensor product of lattices and for
the modular monoid. The work conforms with the constructive constraints of
geometric logic.

This paper is largely a review of known results about various
aspects of geometric logic.
Following Grothendieck's view of toposes as
generalized spaces,
one can take geometric morphisms as generalized continuous maps.
The constructivist constraints of geometric logic guarantee
the continuity of maps constructed,
and can do so from two different points of view:
for maps as point transformers and maps as bundles.</p>

This paper introduces an endofunctor <i>V<sub>T</sub></i> on the category of frames, parametrized by
an endofunctor <i>T</i> on the category Set that satisfies certain constraints.
This generalizes Johnstone's
construction of the Vietoris powerlocale, in the sense that his construction is obtained by taking for <i>T</i> the finite covariant power set funtor.
Our construction of the <i>T</i>-powerlocale <i>V<sub>T</sub> L</i> out of a frame
<i>L</i> is based on ideas from coalgebraic logic and makes explicit the connection between the Vietoris construction and Moss's coalgebraic cover modality.</p>
<p>
We show how to extend certain natural transformations between set functors to natural transformations between <i>T</i>-powerlocale functors.
Finally, we prove that the operation <i>V<sub>T</sub></i> preserves
some properties of frames, such as regularity, zero-dimensionality, and the combination of zerodimensionality
and compactness.</p>

Suppose in an arithmetic unverse we have two predicates &phi; and &psi; for
natural numbers, satisfying a base case &phi;(0)&rarr;&psi;(0) and an
induction step that, for generic <i>n</i>, the hypothesis
&phi;(<i>n</i>)&rarr; &psi;(<i>n</i>)
allows one to deduce
&phi;(<i>n</i>+1)&rarr; &psi;(<i>n</i>+1).
Then it is
already true in that arithmetic universe that
(&forall; <i>n</i>)(&phi;(<i>n</i>)&rarr; &psi;(<i>n</i>)).
This is substantially harder than in a topos, where cartesian
closedness allows one to form an exponential
&phi;(<i>n</i>)&rarr; &psi;(<i>n</i>).</p>
<p>
The principle is applied to the question of locatedness of Dedekind sections.</p>
<p>
The development analyses in some detail a notion of "subspace" of an
arithmetic universe, including open or closed subspaces and a boolean algebra
generated by them.
There is a lattice of subspaces generated by the opens and the closeds,
and it is isomorphic to the free Boolean algebra over the distributive lattice
of subobjects of 1 in the arithmetic universe.</p>

Dcpos can be presented by a preorder of generators and inequational relations
expressed as covers. Algebraic operations on the generators (possibly with their
results being ideals of generators) can be extended to the dcpo presented,
provided the covers are "stable" for the operations. The resulting dcpo algebra
has a natural universal characterization and satisfies all the inequational laws
satisfied by the generating algebra.</p>

<p>
The localic definitions of cosheaves, connectedness and local connectedness
are transferred from impredicative topos theory to predicative formal
topology. A formal topology is locally connected (has base of connected opens)
iff it has a cosheaf &pi;<sub>0</sub> together with certain additional structure and
properties that constrain &pi;<sub>0</sub> to be the connected components cosheaf. In
the inductively generated case, complete spreads (in the sense of Bunge and
Funk) corresponding to cosheaves are defined as formal topologies. Maps
between the complete spreads are equivalent to homomorphisms between the
cosheaves. A cosheaf is the connected components cosheaf for a locally
connected formal topology iff its complete spread is a homeomorphism, and in
this case it is a terminal cosheaf.</p>
<p>
A new, geometric proof is given of the topos-theoretic result that a cosheaf
is a connected components cosheaf iff it is a "strongly terminal" point of
the symmetric topos, in the sense that it is terminal amongst all the
<i>generalized</i> points of the symmetric topos. It is conjectured that a
study of sites as "formal toposes" would allow such geometric proofs to be
incorporated into predicative mathematics.</p>

An account of lower and upper integration is given. It is constructive in the
sense of geometric logic. If the integrand takes its values in the
non-negative lower reals, then its lower integral with respect to a valuation
is a lower real. If the integrand takes its values in the non-negative upper
reals, then its upper integral with respect to a covaluation and with domain
of integration bounded by a compact subspace is an upper real. Spaces of
valuations and of covaluations are defined.</p>
<p>
Riemann and Choquet integrals can be calculated in terms of these lower and
upper integrals.</p>

The Vietoris powerlocale <i>VX</i>
is a point-free analogue of the Vietoris
hyperspace. In this paper we introduce and study a sublocale
<i>V<sup>c</sup>X</i> whose
points are those points of <i>VX</i>
that (considered as sublocales of <i>X</i>)
satisfy a constructively strong connectedness property.
<i>V<sup>c</sup>X</i> is a strong monad on
the category of locales. The strength gives rise to a product map<br>
x: <i>V<sup>c</sup>X</i> x <i>V<sup>c</sup>Y</i> -&gt;
<i>V<sup>c</sup></i>(<i>X</i> x <i>Y</i>),<br>
showing that the product of two of these connected sublocales is again connected.
If <i>X</i> is locally connected then <i>V<sup>c</sup>X</i>
is overt. In the case where <i>X</i>
is the localic completion of a generalized metric space <i>Y</i>, the points of
<i>V<sup>c</sup>X</i> are characterized as certain Cauchy filters of formal
balls for the finite power set F<i>Y</i>
with respect to a Vietoris metric.</p>
<p>
The results are applied to the particular case of the point-free real
line,
giving a choice-free constructive version of the Intermediate
Value Theorem and Rolle's Theorem.</p>
<p>
The work is constructive in the sense of topos-validity with natural numbers
object. Its geometric aspects (preserved under inverse image functors) are
stressed, and exploited to give a pointwise development of the point-free
locale theory. The connected Vietoris powerlocale itself is a geometric construction.</p>

<p>
This chapter was written as an introduction for logicians to the
spatial content of geometric logic.</p>
<p>
It first outlines the established ideas of Lindenbaum algebras of
logical theories, and how they combine with Stone duality (between
Boolean algebras and Stone topological spaces) to give a correspondence
between theories in classical propositional logic and Stone spaces.
This enables one to treat logical theories as topological spaces.</p>
<p>
The aim of the chapter is to show how the same insights can be applied
to geometric logic, whose connectives mirror the axioms of topology,
even though its incompleteness means there is no exact Stone duality.</p>
<p>
An important part of this is the role of constructive reasoning. This
is paradoxical, since without classical principles (such as choice) it
becomes even harder to find the models needed to show completeness.
However, constructive reasoning can be applied to models in
non-classical mathematics, and in particular the internal mathematics
of sheaves. This has the effect of allowing access to a sufficiency of
models.</p>
<p>
The chapter also describes how the same principles apply to theories in
predicate geometric logic. However, the spaces are now <span
 style="font-style: italic;">generalized</span> in Grothendieck's sense
as toposes. The chapter describes how the categorical technicalities of
topos theory (e.g. in Mac Lane and Moerdijk) connects to the spatial
intuitions.</p>

<p>
A logic is developed in which function symbols are allowed to represent
partial functions. It has the usual rules of logic
(in the form of a sequent calculus) except that the substitution rule
has to be modified. It is developed here in its minimal form,
with equality and conjunction, as "partial Horn logic".</p>
<p>
Various kinds of logical theory are equivalent:
<ul>
  <li>partial Horn theories</li>
  <li>"quasi-equational" theories, partial Horn theories
without predicate symbols</li>
  <li>cartesian theories</li>
  <li>essentially algebraic theories</li>
</ul></p>
<p>
The logic is sound and complete with respect to models in
$\mathbf{Set}$, and sound with respect to
models in any cartesian (finite limit) category.</p>
<p>
The simplicity of the quasi-equational form allows an easy predicative
constructive proof of the free partial model theorem
for cartesian theories: that if a theory morphism is given from one
cartesian theory to another, then the forgetful
(reduct) functor from one model category to the other has a left
adjoint.</p>
<p>
Various examples of quasi-equational theory are studied, including
those of cartesian categories and of other
classes of categories. For each quasi-equational theory $\mathbb{T}$ another,
$\mathrm{Cart}\varpi\mathbb{T}$, is
constructed, whose models are cartesian categories equipped with models
of $\mathbb{T}$.
Its initial model, the "classifying category" for $\mathbb{T}$, has properties
similar to those of the
syntactic category, but more precise with respect to strict cartesian
functors.</p>

The paper studies how the localic notion of sublocale transfers to
formal topology. For any formal topology (not necessarily with
positivity predicate) we define a sublocale to be a cover relation that
includes that of the formal topology. The family of sublocales has
set-indexed joins. For each set of base elements there are
corresponding open and closed sublocales, boolean complements of each
other. They generate a boolean algebra amongst the sublocales. In the
case of an inductively generated formal topology, the collection of
inductively generated sublocales has coframe structure.</p>
<p>
Overt sublocales and weakly closed sublocales are described, and
related via a new notion of "rest closed" sublocale to the binary
positivity predicate. Overt, weakly closed sublocales of an inductively
generated formal topology are in bijection with "lower powerpoints",
arising from the impredicative theory of the lower powerlocale.</p>
<p>
Compact sublocales and fitted sublocales are described. Compact fitted
sublocales of an inductively generated formal topology are in bijection
with "upper powerpoints", arising from the impredicative theory of the
upper powerlocale.</p>

This paper shows how systems can be built from their component parts
with specified sharing. Its principle contribution is a modular
language
for configuring systems. A configuration is a description in the new
language of how a system is constructed hierarchically from
specifications of its component parts. Category theory has been used to
represent the composition of specifications that share a component part
by constructing colimits of diagrams. We reformulated this application
of category theory to view both configured specifications and their
diagrams as algebraic presentations of presheaves. The framework of
presheaves leads naturally to a configuration lanaguage that expresses
structuring from instances of specifications, and also incorporates a
new notion of instance reduction from a particular configuration . The
language now expresses the hierarchical structuring of multi-level
configured specifications. The syntax is simple because it is
independent of any specification language; structuring a diagram to
represent a configuration is simple because there is no need to
calculate a colimit; and combining specifications is simple because
structuring is by configuration morphisms with no need to flatten
either
specifications or their diagrams to calculate colimits.</p>

The work investigates the powerlocales (lower, upper, Vietoris) of localic
completions of generalized metric spaces. The main result is that all three
are localic completions of generalized metric powerspaces, on the Kuratowski
finite powerset. This is a constructive, localic version of spatial results of
Bonsangue et al. and of Edalat and Heckmann.</p>
<p>
As applications, a localic completion is always open, and is compact iff its
generalized metric space is totally bounded.</p>

The representation is used to discuss closed intervals of the reals, with the
localic Heine-Borel Theorem as a consequence.</p>

equipped with a metric map from <i>X<sup>2</sup></i> to the interval of
upper reals (approximated from above but not from below) from 0 to

The category $\mathbf{SCFr}_U$ of stably continuous
frames and preframe homomorphisms (preserving finite meets and directed
joins) is dual to the Karoubi envelope of a category
$\mathbf{Ent}$ whose objects are sets and whose
morphisms $X \rightarrow Y$ are upper closed relations between
the finite powersets $\mathcal{F}X$ and $\mathcal{F}Y$.
Composition of these morphisms is the "cut composition" of
Jung et al. that interfaces disjunction in the codomains with
conjunctions in the domains, and thereby relates to their <em>multi-lingual
sequent calculus</em>. Thus stably locally compact locales are
represented by "entailment systems" $(X,\vdash)$
in which $\vdash$, a generalization of entailment relations, is idempotent
for cut composition.</p>
<p>
Some constructions on stably
locally compact locales are represented in terms of entailment systems:
products, duality and powerlocales.</p>
<p>
Relational converse provides $\mathbf{Ent}$ with an involution, and this
gives a simple treatment of the duality of stably locally compact
locales. If $A$ and $ B$ are stably continuous frames, then
the internal preframe hom $A \pitchfork B$ is isomorphic to
$\hat{A} \otimes B$
where $\hat{A}$ is the Hofmann-Lawson dual.</p>
<p>
For a stably locally compact locale $X$, the lower powerlocale of
$X$ is shown to be the dual of
the upper powerlocale of the dual of $X$.</p>

The double powerlocale $\mathbb{P}(X)$ (found by composing, in either
order, the upper and lower powerlocale constructions $P_U$ and $P_L$)
is shown to be isomorphic in
$[\mathbf{Loc}^{op}, \mathbf{Set}]$
to the double exponential $\mathbb{S}^{\mathbb{S}^X}$
where $\mathbb{S}$ is the Sierpinski locale. Further,
$P_U(X)$ and $P_L(X)$ are shown
to be the subobjects of $\mathbb{P}(X)$ comprising, respectively, the
meet semilattice and join semilattice homomorphisms. A key lemma shows
that, for any locales $X$ and $Y$,
natural transformations from $\mathbb{S}^X$
(the presheaf $\mathbf{Loc}(- \times X, \mathbb{S})$) to $\mathbb{S}^Y$
(i.e. $\mathbf{Loc}(- \times Y, \mathbb{S})$) are
equivalent to dcpo morphisms from the frame $\Omega(X)$ of $X$
to that of $Y$. It is also shown that $\mathbb{S}^X$
has a localic reflection in
$[\mathbf{Loc}^{op}, \mathbf{Set}]$ whose
frame is $\mathbf{dcpo}(\Omega(X), \Omega(Y))$.</p>

If a locale is presented by a

and relations as a dcpo. A necessary and sufficient condition is
derived
for compactness of the locale (and also for its openness). Although its
derivation uses impredicative constructions, it is also shown
predicatively using the inductive generation of formal topologies.</p>

If $X$ is a locale, then its double powerlocale
$\mathbb{P}(X)$ is defined to be $P_U(P_L(X))$
where $P_U$ and $P_L$ are the upper and lower powerlocale constructions.
We prove various results relating it to exponentiation of locales,
including the following.
First, if $X$ is a
locale for which the exponential $\mathbb{S}^X$ exists
(where $\mathbb{S}$ is the Sierpinski locale),
then $\mathbb{P}(X)$ is an exponential $\mathbb{S}^{\mathbb{S}^X}$.
Second, if in addition $W$
is a locale for which $\mathbb{P}(W)$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^X$,
then $X$ is an
exponential $\mathbb{S}^W$.</p>
<p>
The work uses geometric reasoning, i.e.
reasoning stable under pullback along geometric morphisms, and this
enables the locales to be discussed using their points as though they
were spaces. It relies on a number of geometricity results including
those for locale presentations and for powerlocales.</p>

The approach to process semantics using quantales and modules is
topologized by considering tropological systems whose sets of states
are
replaced by locales and which satisfy a suitable stability axiom. A
corresponding notion of localic sup-lattice (algebra for the lower
powerlocale monad) is described, and it is shown that there are
contravariant functors from sup-lattices to localic sup-latices and,
for
each quantale <i>Q</i>, from left <i>Q</i>-modules to localic right <i>Q</i>-modules.
A proof technique for third completeness due to <a href="#QOLPS">Abramsky and

The paper addresses a notion of configuring systems, constructing
them from specified component parts with specified sharing. This notion
is independent of any underlying specification language and has been
abstractly identified with the taking of colimits in category theory.
Mathematically it is known that these can be expressed by presheaves
and
the present paper applies this idea to configuration. </p>
<p>
We interpret the category theory informally as follows. Suppose <i>C</i> is
a category whose objects are interpreted as specifications, and for
which each morphism <i>u</i>: <i>X</i> -&gt; <i>Y</i> is interpreted as contravariant
"instance reduction", reducing instances of specification <i>Y</i> to instances
of <i>X</i>. Then a presheaf <i>P</i> over <i>C</i> represents a collection of instances
that
is closed under reduction. We develop an algebraic account of
presheaves
in which we present configurations by generators (for components) and
relations (for shared reducts), and we outline a proposed configuration
language based on the techniques. Oriat uses diagrams to express
colimits of specifications, and we show that Oriat's category Diag(<i>C</i>)
of
finite diagrams is equivalent to the category of finitely presented
presheaves over <i>C</i>.</p>

Certain "Finite Structure Conditions" on a geometric theory are

topos.
The conditions assert that every homomorphism from a finite structure

the theory to a model factors via a finite model, and they hold in
cases
where the finitely presentable models are all finite. </p>

We give a constructive localic account of the completion of
quasimetric spaces. In the context of Lawvere's approach, using
enriched
categories, the points of the completion are flat left modules over the
quasimetric space. The completion is a triquotient surjective image of
a
space of Cauchy sequences and can also be embedded in a continuous
dcpo,
the "ball domain". Various examples and constructions are given,
including the upper, lower and Vietoris powerlocales, which are
completions of finite powerspaces. The exposition uses the language of
locales as "topology-free spaces". <br>

It is shown how many techniques of categorical domain theory can be
expressed in the general context of topical categories (where "topical"
means internal in the category Top of Grothendieck toposes with
geometric morphisms). The underlying topos machinery is hidden by using
a geometric form of constructive mathematics, which enables toposes as
"generalized topological spaces" to be treated in a transparently
spatial way, and also shows the constructivity of the arguments. The
theory of strongly algebraic (SFP) domains is given as a case study in
which the topical category is Cartesian closed. </p>
<p>Properties of local toposes and of lifting of toposes (sconing) are
summarized, and it is shown that the category of toposes has a fixpoint
object in the sense of Crole and Pitts. This is used to show that for a
local topos, all endomaps have initial algebras, and this provides a
general context in which to describe fixpoint constructions including
the solution of domain equations involving constructors of mixed
variance. Covariance with respect to embedding-projection pairs or
adjunctions arises in a natural way. </p>
<p>The paper also provides a summary of constructive results concerning
Kuratowski finite sets, including a novel strong induction principle;
and shows that the topical categories of sets, finite sets and
decidable
sets are not Cartesian closed (unlike the cases of finite decidable
sets
and strongly algebraic domains). <br>

The Kripke-Joyal semantics is used to interpret the fragment of
intuitionistic logic containing conjunction, implication, equality and
universal quantification in the category of locales. An axiomatic
theory
is developed that can be interpreted soundly in two ways, using either
lower or upper powerlocales, so that pairs of separate results can be
proved as single formal theorems. </p>

Openness and properness of maps between locales are characterized by
descriptions using the logic, and it is proved that a locale is open
iff

The method of information systems is extended from algebraic posets
to continuous posets by taking a set of tokens with an ordering that is
transitive and interpolative but not necessarily reflexive. This
develops results of Raney on completely distributive lattices and of
Hoofman on continuous Scott domains, and also generalizes Smyth's
"R-structures". Various constructions on continuous posets have neat
descriptions in terms of these continuous information systems; here we
describe Hoffmann-Lawson duality (which could not be done easily with
R-structures) and Vietoris power locales. We also use the method to
give
a partial answer to a question of Johnstone's: in the context of
continuous posets, Vietoris algebras are the same as localic
semilattices. </p>

Preframes (directed complete posets with finite meets that
distribute over the directed joins) are the algebras for an infinitary
essentially algebraic theory, and can be presented by generators and
relations. This result is combined with a general argument concerning
categories of commutative monoids to give a very short proof of the
localic Tychonoff Theorem. It is also shown how frames can be presented
as preframes, a result analogous to Johnstone's construction of frames
from sites, and an application is given. </p>

An advanced textbook on topology for computer scientists with three
unusual features. First, the introduction is from a localic viewpoint,
motivated by the logic of finite observations: this provides a more
direct approach than the traditional one based on abstracting
properties
of open sets in the real line. Second, the methods of locale theory are
freely exploited. Third, there is a substantial discussion of some
computer science applications. Although books on topology aimed at
mathematics exist, not book has been written specifically for computer
scientists, and as computer scientists become more aware of the
mathematical foundations of their discipline, it is appropriate that
such topics are presented in a form of direct relevance and
applicability. This book goes some way towards bridging the gap. </p>

The ring of <i>p</i>-adic integers can be embedded as the maximal
elements in a Scott domain with algebraic structure. We show how
definitions and proofs in the mathematical theory of <i>p</i>-adics
can
be replaced by algorithms on the partial elements and formal
programming
methods working on the algorithms. Certain types of argumetns translate
naturally into non-deterministic algorithms using the Smyth power
domain. </p>

This paper is not, and is not intended to be, original. Its purpose
is to present a couple of examples from the folklore of topos theory,
the theory of classifying topoi in particular. This theory and its
applications spread initially without the benefit of widespread
publication. Many ideas were spread among a relatively small group,
largely by word of mouth. The result of this is that the literature
does
not provide an accessible introduction to the subject. Computer
scientists studying the logic of computing have recently become
interested in this area. They form our intended audience. In the space
(and time) available we can only hope to provide a small selection of
the many ideas missing from, or buried in, the literature. We attempt
to
give a perspective of the structure of the subject. Our selection is,
of
necessity, idiosyncratic, and our treatment brief. We hope that missing
technical details may be reconstructed from the literature. This may
require some diligence. [Yes, it did - SJV] </p>
<p>To apportion credit for the ideas presented here is difficult so
long after the event. Lawvere and Joyal have a special position in htis
subject. Their intuitions have shaped it. Many others, who participated
in the Peripatetic Seminars in Europe, the New York Topos Theory
Seminar
(which also wandered) and the Category Theory meetings at Oberwohlfach,
contributed also. Their contributions are, in general, better reflected
in their published works. Finally, to apportion blame, this paper
derives from notes taken by SJV of a talk by MPF. Any
misrepresentations
are the responsibility of the latter. </p>
