<h1><a href="research.html">Research</a></h1>
<p>
Since October 2018 I have retired, so that I can focus on my <a href="research.html">research</a>.
I am an honorary senior researcher in the School of Computer Science at Birmingham University, and a member of the
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/groupings/theory/">Theoretical Computer Science</a> research group.
</p>
<p>
My particular interest is in toposes as generalized spaces,
with the connection between logic (specifically, geometric logic) and topology.
These are areas of mathematics that have connections
with computer science, although my work in them is often purely
mathematical.
Over 2017-18 I formalized an approach to topos theory
using Joyal's Arithmetic Universes (AUs) as a substitute for
Grothendieck toposes, potentially implementable on computers,
and showed how to use it to obtain constructive,
base-free results for toposes.
My current work is on developing the techniques of this approach
and exploring the extent to which it can capture Grothendieck's
original applications of topos theory.
</p>
<p>Before I joined Birmingham I was at the <a
 href="http://mcs.open.ac.uk/puremaths/">Department of Pure Maths</a>
at
the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University</a>, and before
that I was at the <a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/">Department of
Computing</a> at <a href="http://www.ic.ac.uk/">Imperial College</a>,
where I worked in the <a href="http://theory.doc.ic.ac.uk/">Theory and
Formal Methods</a> group. </p>
<p>You can download many of my <a href="papers.html">papers</a>
and <a href="talks.html">talks</a>, and also
theses of some of my former <a href="phds.html">PhD students</a>. </p>
<p>
For three years from September 2009 I was principal investigator on an EPSRC-funded
project
<a href="geophysics.html">Applications of geometric logic to topos approaches
to quantum theory</a>, an interdisciplinary project to
look at the connections between geometric logic and some new topos approaches to quantum physics.
This brought out the importance of bundles as
fibrewise topology (an example of Grothendieck's relativization techniques).
</p>
<p>
In April 2029 I was one of the organizers for the 6th Workshop on Formal Topology (6WFTop).
The <a href="/6WFTop/6WFTopindex.md">workshop pages here</a> are kept for historical interest.

<h1>Teaching</h1>
<p>
I have taught a variety of Computer Science topics,
including Java programming,
reasoning about programs (see the book
"<a href="papersfull.html#ReasProg">Reasoned Programming</a>"),
Introduction to Computer Science (slogan: How programs work),
and Introduction to Maths for Computer Science
(a catch up module for students without previous maths qualifications).

<h1>Previous lives</h1>
<p>
My PhD (at Leeds) was in algebra under the supervision of Alfred Goldie,
and my thesis was "Universal Strongly Regular Rings" (1979).</p>
<p>
After that I was a computer programmer for several years.
I wrote the ROM and user manuals for two Sinclair computers, the ZX81
and the ZX Spectrum. Then with Richard Altwasser I founded Jupiter Cantab Ltd,
which produced the Forth-based Jupiter Ace microcomputer.
