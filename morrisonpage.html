<a href="https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/community/people/alan-morrison">Alan Morrison</a>
wrote his MSc dissertation
"<a href="MorrisonAUs.pdf">Reasoning in Arithmetic Universes</a>"
in 1996 at the Department of Computing, Imperial College, under <a href="index.html">my</a>  supervision.
</p>
<p>
It is an excellent summary of much of what was known then about arithmetic universes from work,
much of it still unpublished, of  Andr&eacute; Joyal and, following him, Gavin Wraith.
