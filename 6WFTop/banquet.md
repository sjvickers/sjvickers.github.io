###Going to the restaurant

Please don't delay, as the meal is booked for 19:00!

Paul Taylor has kindly provided the following directions.

The restaurant is at the orange arrow [on a map](http://www.streetmap.co.uk/idld.srf?X=406407&Y=287450&Z=110).

The following directions are logically very simple,
but to get an overview of the route and work out how
to get to the restaurant after you leave the canal,
it would be a good idea to look at the map.

Noam Zeilberger lives close to the restaurant.
Paul Levy and Benedikt Ahrens also live in the
city centre and may help with directions.
