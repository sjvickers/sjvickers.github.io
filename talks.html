"<a href="RAviaLhandout.pdf">Real analysis via logic</a>" <br>
Talk 7 September 2024 for
<a href="https://blc24.github.io/">British Logic Colloquium BLC24</a>, Birmingham University.
<br>
My recent work with Ming Ng has started to investigate real analysis in a <i>point-free</i> style, suited to topos theory.
I explain how much of this can be explained as logical phenomena.
The space of real numbers is described as a logical theory (for geometric logic), for which real numbers are the models; continuous maps are described by constructions that respect the constraints of geometric logic.
<br>
I shall briefly introduce some examples by which logical constructions provide techniques that are less common in the usual development, or even impossible there.

Talk 30 May 2024 for
<a href="https://topos.site/events/topos-colloquium/">Topos Institute Colloquium</a>.
<br>
Without going too deeply into the underlying topos theory, I first give a short account of what point-free topology is, how it's done using geometric reasoning, and why one might bother.
<br>
I then present as an example the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (that differentiation is the inverse of integration) and an application to differentiating logs. This is an important step in point-free real analysis, and relates strongly to the work initiated in Ming Ng's thesis. It also illustrates some characteristic features of point-free reasoning, such as a focus on one-side reals and a use of hyperspaces and related constructions.

<br>
"Constructive" is in the strict sense, where "there exists" means "we can construct".
I discuss various aspects of the question, and how it might be answered.

It outlines my <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~sjv/papersfull.html#PHLCC">joint paper with Erik Palmgren</a>,
and explains
(I) how AUs hit sweet spot for the Initial Model Theorem;
(II) the algebraic approach to classifying categories that is suggested there;
and (III) how the AU-logic potentially provides foundations for continuous mathematics.

<p><b><i>TACL talks 2017</i></b></p>
<p>
The first four of these talks were given 22-23 June 2017 at the
<a href="http://www.cs.cas.cz/tacl2017/">TACL</a>
summer school, Olomouc, Czech Republic.
Their overall title is "ACLT: Algebra, Categories, Logic in Topology
- Grothendieck's generalized topological spaces (toposes)".
They survey how the ACL disciplines come together
to provide the mathematics of generalized spaces,
but at the same time get modified in various ways that might be unexpected to mainstream ACL practitioners.
</p><p>
The fifth TACL talk was an invited presentation given 28 June 2017
at the TACL workshop the following week in Prague.

<i>WFTop tutorial 2012</i></p>
<p>
This three-part tutorial on "Formal Topology and Geomeric Logic"
was presented at the 4th Workshop on Formal Topology,
Ljubljana, June 2012.
</p><p>
It develops the idea, originating in Grothendieck's work,
that continuity in a greatly generalized sense can be understood
as adherence to principles of geometricity.
