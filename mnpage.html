Summary</p>
<p>
Our starting point has to do with a key tension running through number theory: although all completions of
the rationals Q should be treated symmetrically, this is complicated by fundamental disanalogies between
the p-adics vs. the reals. Whereas prior work has typically been guided by classical point-set reasoning, this
thesis explores various ways of pulling this problem away from the underlying set theory, revealing various
surprises that are obscured by the classical perspective. Framing these investigations is the following test
problem: construct and describe the topos of completions of Q (up to equivalence).
</p><p>
Chapter 2 begins with the preliminaries: we set up the topos-theoretic framework of point-free topology,
with a view towards highlighting the distinction between classical vs. geometric mathematics, before introducing
the number-theoretic context. A key theme is that geometric mathematics possesses an intrinsic
continuity, which forces us to think more carefully about the topological character of classical algebraic
constructions.
</p><p>
Chapter 3 represents the first step towards constructing the topos of completions. Here, we provide a pointfree
account of real exponentiation and logarithms, which will allow us to define the equivalence of completions
geometrically. Chapter 4 provides a geometric proof of Ostrowski's Theorem for both upper-valued
abosolute values on Z as well as Dedekind-valued absolute values on Q, along with some key insights about
the relationship between the multiplicative seminorms and upper reals.
</p><p>
In a slightly more classical interlude, Chapter 5 extends these insights to obtain a surprising generalisation
of a foundational result in Berkovich geometry. Namely, by replacing the use of classical rigid discs with
formal balls, we obtain a classification of the points of Berkovich Spectra M(K{R^{-1}T}) via the language
of filters [more precisely, what we call: R-good filters] even when the base field K is trivially-valued.
</p><p>
Returning to geometricity, Chapter 6 builds upon Chapters 3 and 4 to investigate the space of places of Q
via descent arguments. Here, we uncover an even deeper surprise. Although the non-Archimedean places
correspond to singletons (as is classically expected), the Archimedean place corresponds to the subspace
of upper reals in [0, 1], a sort of blurred unit interval. The chapter then analyses the topological differences
between the non-Archimedean vs. Archimedean places. In particular, we discover that while the topos corresponding
to Archimedean place witnesses non-trivial forking in the connected components of its sheaves,
the topos corresponding to the non-Archimedean place eliminates all kinds of forking phenomena. We then
conclude with some insights and observations, framed by the question: "How should the connected and the
disconnected interact?"
