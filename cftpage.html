<a NAME="PrefrTCLT"></a>"Preframe Techniques in Constructive Locale Theory"</h4>
<p>
PhD Thesis, Department of Computing, Imperial College, 1996. 158 pages.</p>
<p>Our work is entirely constructive; none of the mathematics developed
uses the excluded middle or any choice axioms. No use is made of a natural
numbers object.</p>
<p>
We get a glimpse of the parallel between the preframe approach and the
SUP-lattice approach to locale theory by developing the preframe coverage
theorem and the SUP-lattice coverage theorem side by side and as examples
of a generalized coverage theorem.</p>
<p>
Proper locale maps and open locale maps are defined and seen to be <i>parallel</i>.
We argue that the compact regular locales are parallel to the discrete
locales. It is an examination of this parallel that is the driving force
behind the thesis.</p>
<p>
We proceed with examples: relational composition in <b>Set</b> can be
expressed as a statement about discrete locales; we then appeal to our
parallel and examine relational composition of closed relations of compact
regular locales. A technical achievement of the thesis is the discovery
of a preframe formula for this relational composition.</p>
<p>
We use this formula to investigate ordered compact regular locales (where
the order is required to be closed). We find that Banaschewski and Bruemmer's
compact regular biframes (<i>Stably continuous frames</i> [Math. Proc.
Camb. Phil. Soc. (1988) <b>104</b> 7-19]) are equivalent to the compact
regular posets with closed partial order. We also find that the ordered
Stone locales are equivalent to the coherent locales. This is a localic,
and so constructive, version of Priestley's duality.</p>
<p>
Further, using this relational composition, we can define the Hausdorff
systems as the proper parallel to Vickers' continuous information systems
(<i>Information systems for continuous posets</i> [Theoretical Computer
Science <b>114</b> (1993) 201-229]) The category of continuous information
systems is shown by Vickers to be equivalent to the (constructively) completely
distributive lattices; we prove the proper parallel to this result which
is that the Hausdorff systems are equivalent to the stably locally compact
locales. This last result can be viewed as an extension of Priestley's
duality.</p>

<a NAME="LocPD"></a>"Localic Priestley Duality"</h4>
<p>
Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra <b>116</b> (1997) 323-335.</p>
<p>
Given the category <b>OStoneSp </b>of ordered Stone spaces (as introduced
by Priestley, 1970) and the category <b>CohSp</b> of coherent spaces (=
spectral spaces) one can construct a pair of functors between them which
Priestley (1970) has shown, using the prime ideal theorem, define an equivalence.
<p>In this paper we define ordered Stone locales. These are classically
just the ordered Stone spaces. It is well known that the localic analogue
of the coherent spaces is the category of coherent locales. We prove, entirely
constructively, that the category of coherent locales is equivalent to
the category of ordered Stone locales.
