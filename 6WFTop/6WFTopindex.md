title: 6th Workshop on Formal Topology

6WFTop
======

The 6th Workshop on Formal Topology (6WFTop) will be hosted by the
[School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/)
at the University of Birmingham, UK, in the week Mon 8 to Fri 12 April 2019.
An extension on Sat 13 April will celebrate two birthdays:
the 70th of Giovanni Sambin, and the 65th of Steve Vickers.

These workshops  date back to 1997, and cover point-free topology, broadly interpreted, and its logical foundations. There is always a lively and fruitful interaction between different communities and the meetings have proved fertile ground for developing commonalities different approaches such as predicative type theory, toposes and constructive set theory.

6WFTop will include a tutorial day on the Monday around the theme "What is a space?", in which Matthieu Anel and Benedikt Ahrens will introduce the ideas of toposes and univalent type theory.

In addition, a number of other researchers have accepted an invitation to give a talk: Ingo Blechschmidt, Olivia Caramello, Maria Manuel Clementino, Tatsuji Kawai, Peter Johnstone and Giovanni Sambin.

Participants are invited to offer talks on the topics of the workshop. Please email the organizers with title and abstract. Offers will be considered on a rolling basis by the Programme Committee.

6WFTop is the middle week of successive [Birmingham Spring Meetings](#spring) at the School of Computer Science. 6WFTop participants may also be interested in the other two meetings.
