The 6WFTop would not be possible without financial support from two UK learned societies.

We encourage British participants to consider becoming members, if you are not already.

###[London Mathematical Society](https://www.lms.ac.uk/) (LMS)
The London Mathematical Society is the major UK learned society for mathematics. The Society's activities include publishing journals and books, providing grants to support mathematics and organising scientific meetings and lectures.

Ordinary membership is &pound;84 p.a.
You don't have to be in a mathematics department to be a member.

###[British Logic Colloquium](http://www.blc-logic.org/) (BLC)
The British Logic Colloquium exists to support, promote, and foster the study of logic (especially, but not exclusively, formal and mathematical logic) in Britain. It embraces diverse aspects of logic, from the studies of traditional formal systems to philosophical logic and the modern applications in artificial intelligence, computer science and linguistics; above all, it aims to encourage communication between logicians working in related fields.

Techniques of logic arise in fields far beyond the pure study of logic.
In 6WFTop, much of the interest is in the interaction between logic, and topology and continuity;
and in computer science the formal systems of programs frequently have logical aspects.

Therefore, even if you do not consider yourself a logician,
we strongly recommend BLC membership, at only &pound;10 p.a.
(and free for PhD students),
as an excellent way to support the activities of logic in Britain.
